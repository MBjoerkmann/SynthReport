# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending on
#   the platform. Consequently, Pipfile.lock will differ on different platforms.
#   To avoid tedious conflicts in Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to ignore it in some cases.
#   For instance, if you are developing a library, according to Zen of Python, a library should lock
#   down shipping dependencies well. Pipfile.lock should be ignored in this case.
#   See also: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/598
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The two files above have been commented out becuase in some cases, it may be desirable to ignore
#   them. For example, if you are developing a library that supports multiple platforms and Python
#   versions.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
